# Encyrption settings
# (inspired by http://blog.altudov.com/2010/09/27/using-openssl-for-asymmetric-encryption-of-backups/)
#
# Once the backup done, each SQL dump will be encrypted and the original file
# will be deleted (if encryption was successful).
# It is recommended to backup into a staging directory, and then use the
# POSTBACKUP script to sync the encrypted files to the desired location.
#
# Encryption uses private/public keys. You can generate the key pairs like the following:
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 100000 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout backup.key -out backup.crt -subj '/'
#
# Decryption:
# openssl smime -decrypt -in backup.sql.gz.enc -binary -inform DEM -inkey backup.key -out backup.sql.gz
